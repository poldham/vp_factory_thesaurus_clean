## Cleaning Write Up


Universities present a number of challenges

- Name reversals

- State and private university distinctions (e.g. in the united states) e.g, state university of new york and new york university
- Abbreviations and acronyms (e.g. MIT, UCLA)
- International variations in naming conventions (e.g. University of Oxford vs Oxford University)
- Language differences and translations (e.g. Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México vs National Autonomous University of
 Mexico)
- Campus distinctions within larger university systems (e.g. University of California, Berkeley vs University of California, Los Angeles)
- Historical name changes (e.g. Trinity College becoming Duke University)
- Typographical errors and misspellings (e.g. Harverd University vs Harvard University)
- Use of honorifics and titles (e.g. St. John's University vs Saint John's
- References to Regents or Trustes (e.g. University of California Regents vs University of California)

## Institutes Clean Up

- Distinct institutes in distinct countries may have the same name (e.g. national institute of health)
- Distinct institutes in the same country may have the same name (e.g. Biotechnology Institute)
- The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has many distinct institutes with similar names often distinguished by a city in the name
- The Chines Academy of Agricultural Sciences has many distinct institutes with similar names often distinguished by a city in the name
- In China the Peoples Liberation Army may be expressed as PLA and has many difrerent institutes


## General Rules

- the umbrella term is the name with the highest frequency
- abbreviations such as univ are avoided
- care is required with university hospitals because a hospital may be attached to a university or
it may itself be a university. For example Antwerp University Hospital is a university in its own right
while Harvard University Hospital is a hospital attached to Harvard University
